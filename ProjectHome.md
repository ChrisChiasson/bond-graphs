This Mathematica package allows for the construction of bond graphs, bond graph adjacency matrices, and bond graph equation systems. Limitations: This package can't handle transformers, gyrators, multidimensional bonds, or differential causality. Transformer and gyrator support should not be too hard to add though. If you decide to extend this package, please consider contributing your extensions.
